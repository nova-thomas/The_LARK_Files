Larry Langford couldn't have been a day over 25 by your estimates. Makes you wonder why he got into gardening at such a young age. He has a small cut on his left forearm, most likely from some thorn or garden tool, you suppose. As you approach him, he rises from the garden bed he was working on, and you see that he's quite tall and muscular.
