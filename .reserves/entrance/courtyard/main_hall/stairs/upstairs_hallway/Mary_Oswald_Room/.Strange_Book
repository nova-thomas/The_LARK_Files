There was an odd looking book hiding underneath the bed. When you look inside, you see a bunch of strange images and symbols.

Put this in your inventory by typing "take .Strange_Book"
(This creates a variable and adds on a file location to the variable, creating a list of file locations)

You can view your inventory by typing "\$inventory".
