# John Oswald

cat << EOF
The eldest of the Oswald children. He seems like a very stressed out young man, with his eyes darting everywhere. He's tapping the billiard table constantly as he leans against it. You think you can remember his name from the local newspaper that you read recently. Something about him winning a math competition in the same weekend as a huge football game.
