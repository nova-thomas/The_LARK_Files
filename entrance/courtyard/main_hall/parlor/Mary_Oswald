cat << EOF
Mary Oswald is the youngest of the three kids, if you remember your notes correctly. She seems quite timid and shy, although you don't know if that's how she usually is, or if it's just because of what happened to her father. Whatever the case, she never meets your eyes when you try to talk to her.
