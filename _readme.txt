Developed by: Nova Thomas

Narrative: 
You are a world famous detective, and you have just been assigned an unusual murder case. Prior to arriving at the
Oswald residence, you were informed that Sir Walter Oswald, the head of the household has been murdered in the 
upstairs office. Scattered throughout the house are various members of the family, as well as the staff of the house
that the Oswald's employ. Your mission is to investigate the house, collecting clues, and figuring out who murdered 
poor Mr. Oswald. 

Instructions: 
Before anything else, type ". ./setup.sh". This will run a command to set up the game and background systems.

When you believe that you have figured out who murdered Sir Walter Oswald, find the Butler, and interact with him. He
is the one who you will bring your findings to.

Common Commands:
ls (directory/file) - Use the current directory to "look" around the room, and use "ls inventory" to check your inventory.
ls -a - Use this to look around the current "room" very closely for hidden items.
tail (file) - Use this to "inspect" an item or character.
mv (file) ~/The_LARK_Files_Nova_Thomas/inventory - Used for moving an item to your inventory.
./(script name) - Use this for interacting with characters and items.

You can read this at any time by typing "cat ~/The_LARK_Files_Nova_Thomas/_readme.txt".

Happy Sleuthing!
